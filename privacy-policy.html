                    <h4>11. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our Site uses cookies solely for essential site functionality. We do not use tracking or advertising cookies.
                    </p>

                    <h5>11.1 What Are Cookies</h5>

                    <h4>12. Cross-Platform Integration</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dlightning offers multiple integrated platforms including the Experience Builder and Screen Builder. Please be aware of the following regarding cross-platform usage:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>When you create an account with Dlightning, a single user profile is established that works across our platforms (Experience Builder and Screen Builder).</li>
                        <li>User profile information, including contact details, preferences, and account settings, is shared between these platforms.</li>
                        <li>Projects created in one platform may be accessible from the other platform.</li>
                        <li>Actions taken on one platform (such as changing account information) may affect your experience on all Dlightning platforms.</li>
                        <li>Account deletion will remove your data from all connected Dlightning platforms.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        This integration allows for a seamless user experience across our ecosystem of tools, but it's important to understand that information provided in one context may be available in another context within Dlightning platforms.
                    </p>
