<p class="first-pgh">Human eyes detect roughly 0.0035% of the electromagnetic spectrum. That's it. The rainbow we see, from deep violet through brilliant red, represents a sliver so thin that if the entire spectrum were a football field, our visible portion would be about the width of a pencil line.</p>

<p>The electromagnetic spectrum stretches from gamma rays with wavelengths smaller than atomic nuclei to radio waves that can span kilometers. Between these extremes lie X-rays, ultraviolet light, infrared, microwaves, entire universes of information flowing around us, invisible to our biology.</p>

<p>What we call “reality” is a filtered feed curated by evolution for survival, not truth. We don’t perceive the world as it is. We perceive it as it is useful.</p>

<p>German philosopher Immanuel Kant suggested, we never experience the thing-in-itself, only the phenomena shaped by our categories of understanding. The map is not the territory. The interface is not the code.</p>

<p>Yet we design entire experiences around this narrow window, as if what we see is all there is to see.</p>

<p>A bee sees ultraviolet patterns on flowers that guide it to nectar, patterns completely hidden from us. A snake detects the infrared heat signature of prey in total darkness. Infrared cameras show heat loss in buildings, ultraviolet photography exposes hidden details in art restoration, radio telescopes capture the trace of distant galaxies.</p>

<p>We live in a world built around human perception, but the world is far richer than what our senses reveal.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important insight isn't about what we're missing, but remembering that we're missing it.</p>

<p>Good design acknowledges its own limitations. It leaves room for the invisible, the unmeasured, the unknown. It recognizes that everyone brings their own spectrums of perception—cultural, emotional, experiential—that extend far beyond what our designs can capture.</p>

<p>When we design interfaces, we're not just working with pixels and interactions. We're working with the fundamental human experience of trying to understand the world through limited senses.</p>

<p>The light spectrum reminds us that clarity isn't about seeing everything. It's about seeing what matters within the range available to us.</p>

<p>What social, emotional, or environmental phenomena exist just beyond our perceptual bandwidth? If we want to design with deeper empathy, maybe we need to begin by acknowledging our blindness.</p>
