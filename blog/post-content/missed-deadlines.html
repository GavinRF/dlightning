<p>I missed my deadline for the last time, and up until now, I had blown every single one. This was the final edit; time to complete the writing project that had consumed the past three years of my life.</p>

<p><i>I hadn’t anticipated 120 new comments from the editor this late in the game.</i></p>

<p>How did I not plunge into chaos?
Deadlines are often arbitrary, and on this occasion, I had set the deadlines myself.</p>

<p>My writing process was marked by a series of finishing dates, only to realize that the task was more challenging and would take more time than anticipated. I started writing <i>‘Your Cup of Tea’</i> in July 2020, and published the book on January 31st, 2024; my final self-imposed deadline.</p>

<p>Progressing towards a final product was not a linear process; it involved cycles of refinement. I couldn’t predict when the book would be finished. Besides, I’d rather the project take more time and be of high quality, than be rushed due to a sense of urgency.</p>

<p>As I reached the end of an increment, I estimated a new cutoff for producing a final product proclaiming, “On this day 👇 I will finish my book.”, when that day came, and it wasn’t, I didn’t get dissapointed. Instead, I reset the clock and recommitted myself.</p>

<p>As a strategy for enduring self-directed work, I found deadlines useful. The mental game of sticking with it is fraught with distractions and disillusionment. Assuming I had put in the effort, each time gate was met with a sense of progress. By embracing the organic lifespan of my project, I continued to stay positive throughout many challenges.</p>

<p>In the past I’ve had difficulties completing personal projects, so it feels immensely satisfying to have this one in the bag. Deadlines became a motivational tool that applied the necessary pressure to push me towards the ultimate joy of completing the book.</p>
